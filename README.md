# industrial_objects_dataset

> Essential tools and components for manual assemblies.

## Description ##

This dataset is a compilation of images that contain tools such as drills, hammers, pliers, scredrivers, wrenches; and complements as bolts, clamps, nuts, gears, screws, washers ; and accesories such as drill bits and sockets. The project was developed by taking pictures of each one of the elements listed and also downloading images from the internet, then the Data Augmentation for Object Detection(YOLO) (link below) was used to increase the data volume to complete the dataset.

This dataset also contains videos of an operator performing various of the characteristic actions of each of the tools listed previously, this videos come in separated by frames.
